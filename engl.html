            <div id="desc1" class="description" style="display: none;">
                <p>Notifications are some of the most massive problems associated with phones, each times a person sees a notification they will most probably have an instant
                    urge to check it thus it can cause the loss of attention during work or absolutely anything else. The distraction caused by the notifications can be 
                    removed by simply disabling the notifications in all of the unnecessary programs. Personally I recommend disabling all of the things except direct messages
                    from the close ones.

            <div id="desc2" class="description" style="display: none;">
                <p>It isnt a secret that recently with the rise of all of the short form content and social media the attention spans of millions have been greatly damaged.
                Some of the most destructive social media platforms are tiktok, youtube shorts and instagram reels; their only goal has been 
                to capture the viewers attention in the most ways possible. This is so distructuve because at the moment a HUGE amount of content on those
                social medias is just an ai generated voice or a scene from cartoon playing out while in the bottom there is some satisfying or attention grabbing content playing out.
                This is so terribble because now many young people cant even focus on the most basic stuff like school and thus cause huge damage to their lively hoods potentially loosing out on education.

                <p>Most people cannot live a day without their phone so even when they leave their phone at one place and don't touch it for a while it 
                    can cause stress since they could be "missing out" on important stuff which may cause anxiety in their minds.

                <p>The sadness that mobile programs bring is immense, some of the biggest causes of it is when a person has a bad day and sees someone having a 
                    good time, this will likely cause the unhappy person to be jealous and even more sad about themselves.

        <h3>Ways to fix the addiction?</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>*One of the best ways to fix the addiction is by turning on the "All Grey Mode" on your phone to make it more boring.
                *Another good way of making phones less addictive is to deleting all of the unnecessary and addictive apps. This is a good way to get rid of distractions.
                *Finding a new hobby or activity can help reducing your screen time and actually doing something useful or not as harmful.
                *You could also get rid of your normal phone for a while and get a dumbphone, a dumbphone has a simple messanger and a calling system so you will not miss out on 
                communication and will most probably quickly lose interest in your phone.
